# Library Management System

## Overview
The Library Management System is a software application designed to help manage library operations efficiently. It supports both library administrators (staff) and members, providing features for managing books, members, reservations, and loan transactions. The system is divided into two main interfaces: **Admin Dashboard** and **Member Dashboard**, allowing users to interact with the library based on their roles.


## Key Entities
- **Books**: Contains information like title, author, and availability.
- **Members**: Tracks users who can borrow books.
- **Loans**: Manages borrowing and returning of books.
