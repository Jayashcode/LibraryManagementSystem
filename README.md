# Library Management System

## Overview
The Library Management System is a software application designed to help manage library operations efficiently. It supports both library administrators (staff) and members, providing features for managing books, members, reservations, and loan transactions. The system is divided into two main interfaces: **Admin Dashboard** and **Member Dashboard**, allowing users 
to interact with the library based on their roles.

## What It Does
1. For Members:
   - Search and browse books.
   - View book details.
   - Borrow and return books.
   - Reserve books and cancel reservations.
   - Manage their personal profile and view borrowing history.

2. For Admins:
   - Add, update, and remove books from the catalog.
   - Register and manage library members.
   - Track overdue items and manage reservations.
   - Generate reports and monitor library statistics.

## Key Entities
- **Books**: Contains information like title, author, and availability.
- **Members**: Tracks users who can borrow books.
- **Loans**: Manages borrowing and returning of books.
## Future Enhancements
- Integration with external library systems (e.g., for inter-library loans).
- Mobile app support for ease of access.
- Analytics dashboard for advanced reporting.
